# About
These are a bunch of html+css+js pages that I made to practice my vanilla javascript and css. I made this collection of projects following freeCodeCamp's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8) course. The Guided projects section contains projects that are provided in the curriculum to introduce various html+css concepts to learners. On the other hand, the certification projects sections contain projects that I've made to pass freeCodeCamp's rigorous user stories to get through their course.
